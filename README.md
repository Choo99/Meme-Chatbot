## B. ABSTRACT
  A meme is an idea, behavior, or style that spreads by means of imitation from person to person within a culture and often carries symbolic meaning representing a particular phenomenon or theme. A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices, that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme.
  
  In this AI project, deep learning is used to train our chatbot to analyse and classify the user's emotion accurately which are 'Angry', 'Fear', 'Sad' and 'Joy'. When the user sent a message to the bot, the bot will choose randomly either reply a sentence only or a sentence with a meme image. If the bot is going to sent a meme, the bot will analyse the user's emotion and reply a suitable meme based on the user's emotion.
